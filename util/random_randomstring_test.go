```
Scenario 1: Generate a Random String of Specified Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function generates a string of the specified length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the length of the returned string is equal to the input number.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function correctly generates a string of the requested length, which is a primary requirement of the function.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is crucial to ensure that the function meets its primary objective of generating a string of the specified length.

Scenario 2: Generate a Random String with Zero Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles the edge case of generating a string with zero length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 0.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is empty.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of zero length by returning an empty string.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is important to ensure robustness and proper handling of edge cases.

Scenario 3: Generate a Random String with a Negative Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles invalid input where the length is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to -1.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty string or handles the error appropriately.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function does not attempt to generate a string when given an invalid (negative) length.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is important to verify that the function can gracefully handle invalid input and maintain stability.

Scenario 4: Verify Randomness of Generated Strings

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function generates different strings on multiple invocations with the same input length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function multiple times with the same input number.
    Assert: Verify that the returned strings are different.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function generates random strings and not the same string every time.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is important to ensure the randomness property of the function, which is a key requirement for generating random strings.

Scenario 5: Verify Characters in Generated String are from Alphabet

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the generated string only contains characters from the defined alphabet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that all characters in the returned string are part of the defined alphabet.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function only uses characters from the specified alphabet, maintaining expected behavior.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is important to ensure that the function adheres to constraints and does not introduce unexpected characters.

Scenario 6: Generate a Random String with a Large Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle generating a string with a large length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a large value, e.g., 10000.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the length of the returned string is equal to the input number.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 
      The assertion ensures that the function can handle large inputs and generate the requested string length.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: 
      This test is important to verify the performance and scalability of the function when dealing with large inputs.
