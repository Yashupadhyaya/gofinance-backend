Scenario 1: Generate a Random String of Specified Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function generates a string of the specified length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the length of the returned string is equal to the input number.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The length of the generated string should match the input number because the function is designed to create a string of that exact length.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the function meets the basic requirement of generating strings of specified lengths, which is crucial for any application relying on this functionality.

Scenario 2: Generate a Random String of Length Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles the case where the input number is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to zero.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is an empty string.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An input of zero should result in an empty string because there are no characters to be generated.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the function handles edge cases gracefully, which is important for robustness.

Scenario 3: Generate a Random String and Verify Characters are from Alphabet

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the generated string contains only characters from the defined alphabet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 15.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that each character in the returned string is part of the defined alphabet.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should only use characters from the predefined alphabet.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the generated strings conform to the expected character set, which is critical for consistency and validity in many applications.

Scenario 4: Generate Multiple Random Strings and Verify Uniqueness

Details:
  Description: This test checks if multiple invocations of the function produce different strings.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function multiple times (e.g., 100 times).
    Assert: Verify that the generated strings are unique.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should produce different strings on each call due to randomness.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the randomness is effective and that the function does not produce the same string repeatedly, which is important for generating unique identifiers or tokens.

Scenario 5: Generate a Random String with Large Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when generating a very large string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a large value, e.g., 10000.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the length of the returned string is equal to the input number.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should correctly handle large input sizes and produce a string of the specified length.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the function can handle large inputs without performance degradation or errors, which is important for scalability.

Scenario 6: Generate a Random String with Minimum Length of One

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can generate a string of length one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to one.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the length of the returned string is one and the character is part of the defined alphabet.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should produce a single character string from the alphabet.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the function handles the smallest non-zero input correctly, which is important for flexibility and correctness.

Scenario 7: Consistency of Randomness with Same Seed

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function produces consistent output when the random seed is fixed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a specific value, e.g., 10. Set a fixed seed using rand.Seed.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function multiple times with the same seed.
    Assert: Verify that the generated strings are identical.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: With a fixed seed, the random number generator should produce the same sequence of characters.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the predictability of the functionâ€™s output when a fixed seed is used, which is useful for testing and debugging.

Scenario 8: Random String Generation with Negative Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when given a negative input number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to a negative value, e.g., -5.
    Act: Invoke the RandomString function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is an empty string or handle the error gracefully.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should handle invalid input gracefully, potentially returning an empty string.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the robustness of the function by handling invalid inputs appropriately.
