ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=RandomEmail_7a04f189fd

Scenario 1: Valid Input with Single Character Length
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can correctly generate a random email with a single character before the @ symbol.
Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as the function generates its own data.
    Act: Invoke the RandomEmail function with the parameter 1.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is of length 11 (1 character for the random string, 10 characters for "@email.com").
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the logic that the length of the returned string should be equal to the length of the static string "@email.com" plus the length of the random string. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle minimum valid input.

Scenario 2: Valid Input with Multiple Characters Length
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can correctly generate a random email with multiple characters before the @ symbol.
Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as the function generates its own data.
    Act: Invoke the RandomEmail function with the parameter 5.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is of length 15 (5 characters for the random string, 10 characters for "@email.com").
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the logic that the length of the returned string should be equal to the length of the static string "@email.com" plus the length of the random string. This test is important to check the behavior of the function with typical input.

Scenario 3: Zero Character Length
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle an edge case where the length of the random string is 0.
Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as the function generates its own data.
    Act: Invoke the RandomEmail function with the parameter 0.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is "@email.com".
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the logic that if the length of the random string is 0, the returned string should only contain the static string "@email.com". This test is important to check the behavior of the function with edge case input.

Scenario 4: Negative Character Length
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle an edge case where the length of the random string is negative.
Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as the function generates its own data.
    Act: Invoke the RandomEmail function with a negative number.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is "@email.com".
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the logic that if the length of the random string is negative, the function should treat it as 0 and the returned string should only contain the static string "@email.com". This test is important to check the behavior of the function with invalid input.

'''
In the above test, we first define a series of test cases, each with a name, an input, and the expected length of the output. We then iterate over these test cases, running a subtest for each one.

In each subtest, we invoke the function under test, RandomEmail, with the input from the test case. We then check that the length of the returned string matches the expected length.

If the lengths do not match, we use the t.Errorf function to report an error. This function will not stop the test immediately; instead, it will continue with the next test case. This allows us to see all the failures in one run.

Note that we use the t.Run function to run each subtest. This allows us to run individual subtests separately if we want to. It also makes the output of the test runner easier to read, as it will print the name of each subtest.

Finally, notice that we use the len function to get the length of the returned string. This is a built-in function in Go that works with any type that has a length, including strings.

This test ensures that the RandomEmail function works correctly with various inputs, including edge cases such as zero and negative lengths.
