Scenario 1: Testing RandomString with a positive number

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly generates a random string of the specified length when a positive integer is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a positive integer as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string has the same length as the input parameter.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of returning a random string of the same length as the input parameter. This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Testing RandomString with zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns an empty string when zero is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with zero as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is empty.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of returning an empty string when zero is passed as the parameter. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior in edge cases.

Scenario 3: Testing RandomString with a negative number

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the scenario when a negative integer is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a negative integer as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is empty.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of returning an empty string when a negative number is passed as the parameter. This test is important as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.
