### Test Scenarios for `RandomEmail` Function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Email with Standard Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function generates a valid email address with a typical length for the local part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to a standard value like 10.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(10)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is a valid email address containing 10 characters before `@email.com`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Use regex to validate the email format.
      - Ensure the local part has exactly 10 characters.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function correctly concatenates the random string with the email domain.

#### Scenario 2: Minimum Length Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles the minimum length for the local part correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to 1.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(1)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is a valid email address containing 1 character before `@email.com`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Use regex to validate the email format.
      - Ensure the local part has exactly 1 character.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function can handle edge cases of the smallest possible input size.

#### Scenario 3: Zero Length Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles a zero-length local part, which is an edge case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to 0.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(0)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is `@email.com`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Check if the return value is exactly `@email.com`.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function handles edge cases gracefully, even though it might not be a valid email.

#### Scenario 4: Large Length Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle a very large length for the local part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to 1000.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(1000)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is a valid email address containing 1000 characters before `@email.com`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Use regex to validate the email format.
      - Ensure the local part has exactly 1000 characters.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function can handle large input sizes, which is crucial for robustness.

#### Scenario 5: Valid Email with Special Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can generate a valid email address with special characters in the local part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to 10 and mock `RandomString` to return a string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(10)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is a valid email address containing special characters before `@email.com`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Use regex to validate the email format.
      - Ensure the local part contains special characters.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function can handle special characters in the local part, which is valid in email addresses.

#### Scenario 6: Randomness of Email Addresses

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function generates different email addresses on repeated calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the `number` parameter to a standard value like 10.
    Act: Invoke `RandomEmail(10)` multiple times.
    Assert: Verify that the returned email addresses are different.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      - Ensure the local parts of the returned email addresses are different.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      - Ensures that the function generates truly random email addresses, which is important for use cases like testing or seeding databases.
