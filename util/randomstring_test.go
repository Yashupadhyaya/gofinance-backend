Scenario 1: Testing RandomString with a positive number

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly generates a random string of the specified length when a positive integer is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a positive integer as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string has the correct length.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to check the length of the returned string. The expected result is a random string of the specified length. This test is important to ensure the function is correctly generating random strings of the correct length.

Scenario 2: Testing RandomString with zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns an empty string when zero is passed as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with zero as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is empty.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to check if the returned string is empty. The expected result is an empty string. This test is important to ensure the function is correctly handling the edge case where the requested length of the random string is zero.

Scenario 3: Testing RandomString with a negative number

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles a negative number as the parameter.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are used in the function.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a negative integer as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the behavior of the function.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion depends on the intended behavior of the function when given a negative number. If the function is supposed to return an error, then the assertion should check for that error. If the function is supposed to return an empty string, then the assertion should check for that. The expected result depends on the intended behavior of the function when given a negative number. This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles invalid input.
